Hello, I am Alex, the new programmer.
As you may have noticed, the project is in complete disarray. Due to the foreseen circumstances, I have decided to write a proper framework for the project using a state machine model.
(Refer to Poromagia Draft State Machine png)
Once I have finished writing the state machine logic behind this, the code can be easily reused and rewritten using the Card Recognition code and the API connection code.
